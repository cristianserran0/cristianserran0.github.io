                        <p class="blog-lead-paragraph">I worked on the Small Business Advisors product/service as the only designer assigned 100%. What started as a UX/UI designer role, quickly became a full Product design role, since I had to work with high-level definitions of the service and grow from there, impacting not only on the experience and the visuals of the service, but on the value proposition for the business side. I also worked on the initial content drafts for the landing page and the different tools (merchant facing and internal use), and produced some animations as well.</p>
                        <p class="blog-lead-paragraph">I had the chance to study Google Standards and developed a great dynamic within the team and with the client, making the process of discovery, ideation, and validation super straightforward.</p>
