                    <p class="blog-lead-paragraph">I‚Äôm a designer with 10+ years of experience (5+ working with digital products) who enjoys the challenge of making the complex simple. But surely you already know that from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jy3ijVZLPpWaTv-7tNBefZt1j3gs__lA1xrzTBFTsC0/edit?usp=sharing">my r√©sum√©</a>, or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/cristianserrano">my LinkedIn</a>; let's jump into the more interesting stuff you probably don't know. </p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Design isn't just my job, my role, or something that I‚Äôm good at. Being a designer is something that I just am, it‚Äôs about the way I see the world. I'm curious by nature and I like to think about how everything around me works, and how can I make it better. Weirdly enough, this kind of correlates to the fact that I seem to have an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality">Assertive Logician</a> type of personality.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Curiosity leads to discoveries. And discoveries lead to learning. Well, hopefully. =P Learning opens your mind, and retrofeeds curiosity. And then you end up with this breadth of skills and abilities and interests and there's only so much time to do everything. But it's ok, you're a generalist now. ;)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Working in a big global tech company as Globant I had the chance to be part of really interesting projects, with big clients, playing small parts as well as big ones. I learned that I love having leaders instead of bosses, that a workplace free of toxicity is not only achievable but necessary, that I thrive when given autonomy and creative freedom, and that having a good workplace culture definitely goes a long way.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I get the people looking forward to the weekend because they can't wait to get away from their jobs. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong: I enjoy the weekends as much as the next person, but I love what I do. I look forward to Mondays to come back to work, team up with talented people, and do great stuff even greater.

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I think the next challenge for me is working as an in-house designer. I love that you went from agency work to focus on your own product, thus focusing on your own users. I miss/look forward having ownership of the design process and being there to see the product grow. That's something that isn't always possible doing agency work.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I have the feeling that keeping the company ‚Äúintentionally small‚Äù makes it feel like a second family. A diverse, caring, fun, playful, and hard-working second family. That sounds like a great formula for a nurturing workplace culture, and I‚Äôd really like to be part of it. :)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I love salary transparency, I find it ethical and practical as well. Plus, knowing that you're being fairly compensated enables you to focus more on doing good work, and have an overall better quality of life.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I'm planning on moving to another country, if not next year then the one after that. I don't know where to yet (don't worry, I'll have the 4-hours overlap in mind xD), but working remotely and knowing that my salary will be the same would be a game changer in that regard.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Born and raised in Argentina, where there's always a crisis at hand, we live our day-by-day dealing with uncertainty. We are forced to adapt and reinvent ourselves to find opportunities to grow; we even have a word for it, opportuncrisis. I like to think about it as kind of a cultural trait: we develop resilience to high-uncertainty contexts.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-text-3"><span class="emoji" role="img" aria-label="gear">‚öôÔ∏è </span>Systems-oriented thinking</h3>
                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I see product design (and development, for that matter) holistically, with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, and everything being deeply interconnected. I'm convinced that good design/development is scalable, and scalability needs systems and logic thinking.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Being a fast learner (and, why not, unlearner =P) is one of my strengths. I welcome feedback to iterate myself and, though I prefer to work smart, I can roll up my sleeves and work hard when it‚Äôs needed. I‚Äôm comfortable staying on the path as well as exploring wildly. I love bouncing ideas with other people, but I can work well on my own. Be advised, though: I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo when I feel a change is needed. :P
