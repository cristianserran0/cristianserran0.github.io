But surely you already know that from <a href="">my résumé</a>, or <a href="">my LinkedIn</a>; let's jump into the more interesting stuff you probably don't know. </p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">— WIP — Design isn't just my job, my role, or something that I’m good at. Being a designer is something that I just am, it’s about the way I see the world. I'm curious by nature and I like to think about how everything around me works, and how can I make it better. </p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">— WIP — I'm really curious. I like to think about how everything around me works, and how I can make it better.  Weirdly enough, this seems to correlate to the fact that I seem to have an <a href="">Assertive Logician</a> type of personality.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Working in a big global tech company as Globant I had the chance to be part of really interesting projects, with big clients, playing small parts as well as big ones. I learned that I love having leaders instead of bosses, that a workplace free of toxicity is not only achievable but necessary, that I thrive when given autonomy and creative freedom, and that having a good workplace culture definitely goes a long way.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I get the people looking forward to the weekend because they can't wait to get away from their jobs. Now, don’t get me wrong: I enjoy the weekends as much as the next person, but I love what I do. I look forward to Mondays to come back to work, team up with talented people, and do great stuff even greater.

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I think the next challenge for me is working as an in-house designer. I love that you went from agency work to focus on your own product, thus focusing on your own users. I miss/look forward having ownership of the design process and being there to see the product grow. That's something that isn't always possible doing agency work.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I have the feeling that keeping the company “intentionally small” makes it feel like a second family. A diverse, caring, fun, playful, and hard-working second family. That sounds like a great formula for a nurturing workplace culture, and I’d really like to be part of it. :)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Born and raised in Argentina, where there's always a crisis at hand, we live our day-by-day dealing with uncertainty. We are forced to adapt and reinvent ourselves to find opportunities to grow; we even have a word for it, opportuncrisis. I like to think about it as kind of a cultural trait: we develop resilience to high-uncertainty contexts.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I see product design (and development, for that matter) holistically, with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, and everything being deeply interconnected. I'm convinced that good design/development is scalable, and scalability needs systems and logic thinking.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Being a fast learner (and, why not, unlearner =P) is one of my strengths. I welcome feedback to iterate myself and though I prefer to work smart, I can roll up my sleeves and work hard when it’s needed. I’m comfortable staying on the path as well as exploring wildly. I love bouncing ideas with other people, but I can work well on my own. Be advised, though: I tend to challenge the status quo when I feel a change is needed. =P
