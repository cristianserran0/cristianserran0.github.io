                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Design isn't just my job, my role, or something that I‚Äôm good at. Being a designer is something that I just am, it‚Äôs about the way I see the world. I'm curious by nature and I often find myself thinking about how everything around me works, and how can I make it better.</p>

And then, as time goes by, you end up with this breadth of skills and abilities and interests and there's only so much time to do everything. But that's ok, you're a <a href="https://airbnb.design/defining-design-generalists/" target="_blank">Generalist</a> now; welcome to the big picture. ;)</p>

I learned that I love having leaders instead of bosses, that a workplace free of toxicity is not only achievable but necessary, that I thrive when given autonomy and creative freedom, and that having a good workplace culture definitely goes a long way. -->

I look forward to Mondays to come back to work, team up with talented people, and do great stuff even greater.

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Having worked in startups, agencies, and also with clients as a freelancer, I've found that I do my best work as an in-house designer. I look forward to being part of a strong Design team, having ownership of the design process, and being there to see the product grow. I'm also looking for a place where I can grow into a <a href="https://shareg.pt/fhENdee" target="_blank">Design Operations</a> role.</p>

You believe that in <script>document.write( new Date().getFullYear() );</script> a successfull company should be like a diverse, caring, fun, playful, and hard-working second family. That kind of nurturing workplace can only lead to great relationships, and great relationships lead to great products. :)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Ideally, you advocate for salary transparency; you find it ethical and practical as well. At the very least, you don't encourage salary secrecy and don't mind your employees talking about it because everyone is paid fairly for their efforts. Plus, you know that this enables your employees to have an overall better quality of life and they can focus on doing good work, instead of having to spend time lobbying for their compensation.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">You understand the benefits of allowing employees a flexible schedule. After having experienced on-site positions, as well as hybrid and fully remote ones, I've found that while I can keep my productivity up while working from home, I do miss going every now and then to the office and spending quality time with my teammates. Also, for specific topics like hackathons or Design Sprints, it's very valuable to have a more personal approach.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Born and raised in Argentina, where there's always a crisis at hand, we live our day-by-day dealing with uncertainty. We are forced to adapt and reinvent ourselves to find opportunities to grow; we even have a word for it: Opportuncrisis. I like to think about it as kind of a cultural trait: we develop resilience to high-uncertainty contexts.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I see product design (and development, for that matter) holistically, with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, and everything being deeply interconnected.

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Being a fast learner (and, why not, unlearner =P) is one of my strengths. I welcome feedback to iterate myself and, though I prefer to work smart, I can roll up my sleeves and work hard when it‚Äôs needed. I‚Äôm comfortable staying on the path as well as exploring wildly. I love bouncing ideas with other people, but I can do great work on my own as well, and I'm not afraid challenging the status quo when I feel a change is needed. ;)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">We all know the go-to phrases about teamwork: ‚ÄúIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.‚Äù, "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.", and so on. I know they might sound a bit cheesy, but I genuinely believe them to be true. No one alone can make a difference, together we divide our weaknesses and together we multiply our strenghts. </p>
