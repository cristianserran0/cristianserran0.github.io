                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I think the next challenge for me is working as an in-house designer. I love that you went from agency work to focus on your own product, thus focusing on your own users. I miss/look forward having ownership of the design process and being there to see the product grow. That's something that isn't always possible doing agency work.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">As requirements change and we uncover new design considerations, designers will inevitably need to update the pages that they had previously designed. This leads to two scenarios: the developers are constantly blocked having to wait for design iterations or the development team forges ahead without designs and delivers inconsistent or off-brand user experiences.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Born and raised in Argentina, where there's always a crisis at hand, we live our day-by-day dealing with uncertainty. We are forced to adapt and reinvent ourselves to find opportunities to grow; we even have a word for it, opportuncrisis. I like to think about it as kind of a cultural trait: we develop resilience to high-uncertainty contexts. </p>
