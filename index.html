                    <p class="article-paragraph">As requirements change and we uncover new design considerations, designers will inevitably need to update the pages that they had previously designed. This leads to two scenarios: the developers are constantly blocked having to wait for design iterations or the development team forges ahead without designs and delivers inconsistent or off-brand user experiences.

</h3>
                    <p class="article-paragraph">When we are creating and iterating on products one page at the time, it is likely that the same UI element will be designed and implemented more than once. Not only does this mean that there might be inconsistencies from the get-go, but it also increases the chances that an instance of a button is missed when updates are made in the future.</p>

</h3>
                    <p class="article-paragraph">When getting into details, most likely, another designer on the team has already thought about it, or maybe it’s something that has already been designed on another page. Once that dropdown hover state has been defined once, the designer shouldn’t have to think about it or document it again.

By focusing on isolated, extensible and reusable components we can surface design and implementation challenges much sooner in the process, making easier to see what UI components already exist which reduces a lot of duplicated effort.</p>
