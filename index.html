                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Design isn't just my job, my role, or something that I’m good at. Being a designer is something that I just am, it’s about the way I see the world. I'm curious by nature and I often find myself thinking about how everything around me works, and how can I make it better.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Curiosity leads to discoveries. And discoveries lead to learning. Well, hopefully. =P Learning opens your mind, and retrofeeds curiosity. And then, as time goes by, you end up with this breadth of skills and abilities and interests and there's only so much time to do everything. But that's ok, you're a <a href="https://airbnb.design/defining-design-generalists/" target="_blank">Generalist</a> now; welcome to the big picture. ;)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Working at a big global tech company as Globant I have the chance to be part of really interesting projects, with big clients, playing small parts as well as big ones. I learned that I love having leaders instead of bosses, that a workplace free of toxicity is not only achievable but necessary, that I thrive when given autonomy and creative freedom, and that having a good workplace culture definitely goes a long way.</p>

Now, don’t get me wrong: I enjoy the weekends as much as the next person, but I love what I do. I look forward to Mondays to come back to work, team up with talented people, and do great stuff even greater.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-text-3"><span class="emoji" role="img" aria-label="house with garden">🏡 </span>You're looking for an in-house product designer</h3>
                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I think the next challenge for me is working as an in-house designer. It doesn't matter if your design team is on the three digits or you can count them on the fingers of one hand, I look forward to having ownership of the design process and being there to see the product grow. I'm also looking for a place where I can grow into leading as well.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Context shapes us, and we shape the products we build. You believe that in 2021 a successfull company should be like a diverse, caring, fun, playful, and hard-working second family. That kind of nurturing workplace can only lead to great relationships, and great relationships lead to great products. :)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Ideally, you advocate for salary transparency; you find it ethical and practical as well. At the very least, you don't encourage salary secrecy and don't mind your employees talking about it because everyone is paid fairly for their efforts. Plus, you know that this enables your employees to have an overall better quality of life and they can focus on doing good work, instead of having to spend time lobbying for their compensation.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">You understand the benefits of allowing employees a flexible schedule. This last year and a half of pandemic I've found that, while I can keep my productivity up while working from home, I do miss going a few days a week to the office and spending time with my teammates.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Born and raised in Argentina, where there's always a crisis at hand, we live our day-by-day dealing with uncertainty. We are forced to adapt and reinvent ourselves to find opportunities to grow; we even have a word for it, opportuncrisis. I like to think about it as kind of a cultural trait: we develop resilience to high-uncertainty contexts.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">I see product design (and development, for that matter) holistically, with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, and everything being deeply interconnected. I'm convinced that good design/development is scalable, and scalability needs systems and logic thinking.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Being a fast learner (and, why not, unlearner =P) is one of my strengths. I welcome feedback to iterate myself and, though I prefer to work smart, I can roll up my sleeves and work hard when it’s needed. I’m comfortable staying on the path as well as exploring wildly. I love bouncing ideas with other people, but I can do great work on my own as well, and I'm not afraid challenging the status quo when I feel a change is needed. ;)</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">We all know the go-to phrases about teamwork: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”, "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.", and so on. I know they might sound a bit cheesy, but I genuinely believe them to be true. No one alone can make a difference, together we divide our weaknesses and together we multiply our strenghts. </p>
