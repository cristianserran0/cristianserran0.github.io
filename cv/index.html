I was in charge of the whole design process, from interview with stakeholders and discovery of new functionalities to user flows, visual definitions, and dev handoff. The product was in a very early stage and there was a lot of back and forth regarding definitions and roadmap, so being flexible was key. We eventually launched the first real time marketplace for wireless connectivity.</p>

What started as a UX/UI designer role, quickly became a full Product design role, since I had to work with high-level definitions of the service and grow from there, impacting not only on the experience and the visuals of the service, but on the value proposition for the business side. I also worked on the initial content drafts for the landing page and the different tools (merchant facing and internal use), and produced some animations as well.</p>
                        <p class="blog-paragraph">I had the chance to study Google Standards and developed a great dynamic within the team and the client, making the process of discovery, ideation, and validation super straightforward.</p>
